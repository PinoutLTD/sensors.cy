## üìå Overview

**sensors.social** is a decentralized application that visualizes data from sensors sending their measurements to the blockchain (Polkadot network, Robonomics parachain). The platform supports two modes of operation:

- **Peer-to-peer connectivity** for direct access to sensor data.
- **Federative concept** for accumulating sensor data and displaying measurement history.

For more details on connectivity and how to deploy your own map interface (or even a connectivity server), visit [Robonomics Academy](https://robonomics.academy/en/learn/sensors-connectivity-course/overview/).

## üöÄ Deployment

This section is intended for contributors working on the existing map and developers setting up their own map interface. For comprehensive instructions on configuring your own user interface, refer to the next sections.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Fork & Clone the Repository

If you plan to contribute or customize the project extensively, consider forking it first. Then clone the repository:

```sh
  git clone <map repository>
```

If you plan to contribute or customize the project extensively, consider forking it first.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies

Ensure **Node.js** and **Yarn** are installed:

```sh
 node -v  # Should be >= 16
 yarn -v  # Should be installed
```

Then install the required dependencies:

```sh
 yarn install
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Start the Server Locally for Development

```sh
 yarn dev
```

## üîß Setup Your Own Map (For Experienced Users)

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Deploy Your Own Instance of the Map

Refer to the "üöÄ Deployment" section.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Enable GitHub Actions

To activate GitHub Actions in your repository:

- Navigate to the **Actions** tab in your GitHub repository.
- If prompted, enable workflows by clicking **Enable GitHub Actions**.
- Ensure that workflows are correctly set up in `.github/workflows/`.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Configure Deployment

#### Option 1: Deploy Without a Custom Domain

- Open `.github/workflows/main.yaml` and remove the line:
  ```yaml
  cname: sensors.social
  ```
- Add the following permissions block right below `runs-on: ubuntu-latest`:
  ```yaml
  permissions:
    contents: write
  ```
- In `vite.config.js`, add the following line to the `defineConfig` object, just above the `plugins` section:
  ```javascript
  base: "/<repository_name>/",
  ```
  Replace `<repository_name>` with the name of your fork.

#### Option 2: Deploy With a Custom Domain

- Open `.github/workflows/main.yaml` and replace:
  ```yaml
  cname: sensors.social
  ```
  with your custom domain:
  ```yaml
  cname: your-custom-domain.com
  ```
- Add the following permissions block right below `runs-on: ubuntu-latest`:
  ```yaml
  permissions:
    contents: write
  ```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Finalizing Deployment

After modifying the necessary files, deploy your instance of the map by following these steps:

1. Commit and push the changes to your forked repository:
   ```sh
   git add .
   git commit -m "Configured deployment settings"
   git push origin main
   ```
2. Wait until the GitHub Actions workflow successfully completes.
3. Navigate to the **Pages** section in your repository **Settings**.
4. Enable GitHub Pages by selecting **Deploy from a branch** as the source.
5. Choose the `gh-pages` branch and the root folder.
6. Save the settings‚ÄîGitHub Pages will deploy your instance of the map.

You can now access your deployed map using the provided GitHub Pages URL.

## üí¨ Localization & Translations

You can add a new language to the map by modifying the translation files located in `src/translate/`.  

### üìù Adding a New Language  

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Create a new translation file** in `src/translate/`, e.g., `es.js`.  

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Update `index.js`** in the same folder:  
   - Import your newly created translation file:  

   ```js
   import es from "./es";
   
   export default { en, ru, es };
   ```

  - Add the new language to the language list:

  ```js
    export const languages = [
      { code: "en", title: "English" },
      { code: "ru", title: "–†—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π" },
      { code: "es", title: "Espa√±ol" },
    ];
  ```
  
  ### üìè Translating Measurements  

  Measurement values are located in `src/measurements/`.  
  To support multiple languages, update the relevant files in this folder.  

  ## Files to Update  

| Measurement Type        | File Name |
|-------------------------|-----------|
| Carbon Monoxide        | `co.js` |
| Background Radiation   | `gs.js` |
| Humidity              | `humidity.js` |
| Ammonia (NH‚ÇÉ)         | `nh3.js` |
| Nitrogen Dioxide (NO‚ÇÇ) | `no2.js` |
| Noise Levels          | `noise.js`, `noiseavg.js`, `noisemax.js` |
| PM10 Particulate Matter | `pm10.js` |
| PM2.5 Particulate Matter | `pm25.js` |
| Pressure              | `pressure.js` |
| Temperature           | `temperature.js` |

### Example Translation Update (`humidity.js`)  

To add support for **Spanish (es)**, update the `name`, `nameshort`, and `zones` properties:  

```js

     name: {  
       en: "Humidity",  
       ru: "–í–ª–∞–∂–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å",  
       es: "Humedad"  
     },  
     nameshort: {  
       en: "Humidity",  
       ru: "–í–ª–∞–∂–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å",  
       es: "Humedad"  
     },  

     zones: [  
       {  
         value: 30,  
         color: "#ff4d00",  
         label: {  
           en: "Very dry",  
           ru: "–û—á–µ–Ω—å —Å—É—Ö–æ",  
           es: "Muy seco"  
         }  
       }  
     ]  
  ```
